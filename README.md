A set of scripts to apply different/old microcodes on Intel CPUs.

* `./collect.sh` to collect all the microcodes available in the git history of [CPUMicrocodes](https://github.com/platomav/CPUMicrocodes).
* `./search_supported.py` to check the current CPUID and list compatible microcodes that one may apply.
* `./install_mc.sh <microcode_file_name>` to apply the microcode.
